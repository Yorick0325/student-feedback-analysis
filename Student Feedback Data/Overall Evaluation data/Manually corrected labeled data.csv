"Thank you for amazing lessons throughout this term. I'm super grateful for what you've done for me and I've enjoyed spoken word so much!!! Before you came and taught us at Paxton Academy Sports and Science, I never knew anything about spoken word but now I feel like I've been living under a rock. Spoken word has made me realize that spoken word isn't just about words, it's about important things around the world. Every Friday when Ms. Ngaholam or a substitute says that we have spoken word, I was like ""Yipeee"" but now that today is the last day, I'm so sad because I will miss all the good lessons.",thank amaz lesson throughout term im super grate youv done ive enjoy spoken word much came taught us paxton academi sport scienc never knew anyth spoken word feel like ive live rock spoken word made realiz spoken word isnt word import thing around world everi friday ms ngaholam substitut say spoken word like yipee today last day im sad miss good lesson,1
